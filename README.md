Objective
Predict crop yield using a dataset that includes environmental and agricultural factors such as rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, and macronutrient levels, along with crop yield in Quintals per acre.

Approach
The dataset covers two distinct crops with varying factors influencing yield. Temperature is the most significant predictor, followed by rainfall, with fertilizer and macronutrient levels also playing roles. The Random Forest Regressor model is effective for predicting crop yield based on these factors. Further analysis could explore additional variables and factors affecting crop yield.
